FastFold
========

Automatic folds (that is, folds generated by a fold method different
from `manual`), bog down VIM considerably in insert mode and are often
reevaluated prematurely (for example, when inserting an opening fold marker
whose closing counterpart has yet to be added to complete the fold.)

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text
for a discussion.

With this plug-in, the folds in the currently edited buffer are updated by an
automatic fold method only when saving the buffer (or typing `zuz` in normal
mode), and are kept as is otherwise (by keeping the fold method set to `manual`).

For example, by adding
```
set foldmethod=syntax

let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
let g:vimsyn_folding='af'
let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1
```
to your .vimrc, the folds in your TeX, Vim or XML file are updated by the
`syntax` fold method when saving the buffer (or typing `zuz` in normal mode)
and are kept as is otherwise.

==

The normal mode mapping `zuz` that updates the folds can be disabled by `let
g:Fastfold_no_mappings = 1` or remapped to your favorite keystroke, say `<F5>`,
by adding `nmap <F5> <Plug>(FastFoldUpdate)` to your `.Vimrc`.

==

There is also a command `FastFoldUpdate` to update the folds. This can be
used to update folds whenever you close or open folds by a standard mapping such
as `zx` by adding `nnoremap zx :FastFoldUpdate<CR>zx` to your `.vimrc`.

For convenience, there is an option `g:fastfolde_overwrite_maps` that, when set
to `1` by adding `let g:fastfolde_overwrite_maps = 1` to your `.vimrc`, hooks
`FastFoldUpdate` to the standard mappings `zx,zX,za,zA,zo,zO,zc,zC,zr,zR,zm,zM,zi`
and can be customized by the global variable `g:mapsuffixes` (and that defaults to
`let g:mapsuffixes = ['x','X','a','A','o','O','c','C','r','R','m','M','i']`).

==

This plug-in will overwrite your manual folds when saving the currently edited
buffer, unless you either

- explicitly tell this plug-in to refrain from it via `g:fastfold_skipfiles`, a
  list of regular expressions against which the current file name is matched,
  or
-  when entering the buffer the local and global `foldmethod` were equal to
   `manual` and
  * since then the local and global `foldmethod` have remained equal to `manual`, or
  * since then you did not save the buffer (or typed `zuz` in normal mode) in the meanwhile.

===

`FastFold.vim` integrates with version 1.2 and above of the `restore_view.vim`
plug-in that stores and restores the last folds by the `:mkview` and `:loadview`
if `restore_view.vim` is loaded *AFTER* `FastFold.vim`. (To ensure the correct
autocmd execution order.)
