FastFold ========

Automatic folds (that is, folds generated by a fold method different from `manual`), bog
down VIM considerably in insert mode and often update prematurely (for example, when
inserting an opening fold marker whose closing counterpart has yet to be inserted.)

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text for a discussion.

To overcome this slowdown and premature updating of folds, with this plugin, the folds in
your currently edited buffer are updated by your preferred foldmethod when saving the
buffer, and kept as is otherwise (by keeping the foldmethod set to `manual`).

You can also update the folds manually by a normal mode mapping that defaults to `zuz`
(and can be disabled by `let g:fastfold_no_mappings = 1` or mapped by `<Plug>FastFoldUpdate`)

For example, by adding ``` set foldmethod=syntax

let g:vimsyn_folding='af' let g:tex_fold_enabled=1 let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1 ``` to
your .vimrc, the folds in your TeX, Vim or XML file are updated by the `syntax` foldmethod
when saving.

As a drawback, this plugin will overwrite your manual folds when saving the currently
edited buffer, unless you either
- explicitly tell this plugin to refrain from it via `g:fastfold_skipfiles`, or
- the local and global `foldmethod` is set to `manual`.

There is a fork of the `restore_view.vim` plugin at

http://www.github.com/Konfekt/restore_view

that stores and restores the last folds by the `:mkview` and `:loadview` command and
interplays well with this plugin if `restore_view` is loaded *AFTER* `fastfold`. (To
ensure the correct autocmd execution order.)
