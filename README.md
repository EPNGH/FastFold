FastFold
========

Automatic folds (that is, folds generated by a fold method different
from `manual`), bog down VIM considerably in insert mode and are often
reevaluated prematurely (for example, when inserting an opening fold marker
whose closing counterpart has yet to be inserted.)

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text
for a discussion.

With this plugin, the folds in your currently edited buffer are updated by your
preferred foldmethod only when saving the buffer or typing `zuz` in normal
mode, and are kept as is otherwise (by keeping the foldmethod set to `manual`).

For example, by adding
```
set foldmethod=syntax

let g:vimsyn_folding='af'
let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1
```
to your .vimrc, the folds in your TeX, Vim or XML file are updated by the
`syntax` foldmethod when saving.

As a drawback, this plugin will overwrite your manual folds when saving the
currently edited buffer, unless you either
- explicitly tell this plugin to refrain from it via `g:fastfold_skipfiles`, or
- the local and global `foldmethod` is set to `manual`.

The normal mode mapping `zuz` to force an update of folds can be disabled by
`let g:fastfold_no_mappings = 1` or remapped to your liking by `<Plug>FastFoldUpdate`.

===

`FastFold.vim` integrates with version 1.2 and above of the `restore_view.vim`
plugin that stores and restores the last folds by the `:mkview` and `:loadview`
if `restore_view.vim` is loaded *AFTER* `FastFold.vim`. (To ensure the correct
autocmd execution order.)
