FastFold
========

Automatic folds (that is, folds generated by a fold method different from `manual`), 
bog down VIM considerably in insert mode and update folds prematurely (when inserting
an opening fold marker whose closing counterpart has yet to be inserted.)

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text for a discussion.

To overcome this slowdown and premature updating of folds, with this plugin, the folds
in your currently edited buffer are updated by your preferred foldmethod when saving the
buffer, and kept as is otherwise (by keeping the foldmethod set to `manual`).

For example, by adding
```
set foldmethod=syntax

let g:vimsyn_folding='af'
let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1

```
to your .vimrc, the folds in your TeX, Vim or XML file are updated by 
the `syntax` foldmethod when saving.

As a drawback, this plugin will overwrite your manual folds when saving the currently 
edited buffer, unless you explicitly tell this plugin to refrain from it.
